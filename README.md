`algorithm-benchmark-toolkit` is a Python library designed to analyze and compare the performance of different algorithms across multiple problems automatically. The tool allows you to:  
1. **Process data from CSV files** containing experiment results.  
2. **Perform advanced statistical studies**, such as Friedman tests or post hoc analysis.  
3. **Automatically generate LaTeX reports** with clear, professional tables.  
4. **Create boxplot graphs** to effectively visualize comparisons between algorithms.  

This tool is aimed at researchers and developers interested in algorithm benchmarking studies for artificial intelligence, optimization, machine learning, and more.
